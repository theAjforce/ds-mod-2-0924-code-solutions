# Identifying Palm Oil Plantations, 
## WIDS 2019 Datathon

### Project Goals
Create a CNN that is able to accurately identify which satellite images contain palm oil plantations.

### Why?
"Deforestation through oil palm plantation growth represents an agricultural trend with large economic and environmental impacts. From shampoo to donuts and ice cream, oil palm is present in many everyday products—but many have never heard of it explicitly! Because oil palm grows only in tropical environments, the crop’s expansion has led to deforestation, increased carbon emissions, and biodiversity loss, while at the same time providing many valuable jobs." - <https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/widsdatathon2019/overview>
